# Decisions, job-hunter family (orchestrator-owned shared stack)

Each entry: **what was decided**, **why** (the rationale that made this the choice), and
**consequences** (what future-self needs to honor or know about). Decisions here are durable,
they outlast the session that made them. This is the shared decisions log for the whole
job-hunter family (orchestrator + 5 members). Entries below the split decision pre-date the
family and were made on the v5.2.0 monolith; they remain valid history.

## 2026-05-28, Split the v5.2.0 monolith into a 6-skill orchestrator-template family

**Decision:** Split the monolithic v5.2.0 job-hunter skill into a **6-skill family** — one orchestrator (`job-hunter/`) plus five member skills (`career-profile/`, `job-search/`, `resume-tailor/`, `application-tracker/`, `outcome-learning/`). The **orchestrator owns the `.job-hunter/` workspace** (lifecycle via `init_workspace.py` / `export_workspace.py` / `import_workspace.py`) **and the anti-fabrication invariant** (it guarantees, family-wide, that any member writing resume/profile content routes through resume-tailor's `verify_no_fabrication.py` gate). The **members are standalone jobs-to-be-done** routed by the orchestrator (`context: fork`, inline for ≤2 members, Task fan-out for ≥3). The migration was **copy-not-move**, keeping `main`'s v5.2.0 monolith intact at the repo root until the cutover-approval gate. Members **install together** via `install/` across `.claude` / `.agents` (Codex + OpenClaw) / `.hermes`.

**Why:**
- A 659-line, 16-script monolith bundles five distinct jobs-to-be-done (profile intake, search, tailoring, tracking, learning) under one trigger surface. Splitting lets each member have a sharp single-job description authored for real-LLM routing, while the orchestrator carries the broad router surface and merges output.
- The Orchestrator template (precedent: the social-media family) keeps shared state and the safety contract centrally owned while members stay independently testable and standalone.
- Centralizing the anti-fabrication invariant in the orchestrator (and keeping `verify_no_fabrication.py` inside its only caller, resume-tailor, with its 5 load-bearing tests) ensures the gate is never bypassable by any current or future content-writing member. The gate exists because a real user got a fabricated resume in the v5.2.0 era; it must not regress.
- Copy-not-move keeps the proven, still-shipping v5.2.0 monolith available as a fallback until the family is verified and the user approves cutover. No regression risk during the transition.

**Consequences:**
- The family is at **v6.0.0** (orchestrator `_meta.json version: 6.0.0`; each member at member-version `1.0.0`). Combined suite is **226 tests** (was 201 monolith), all green.
- The family lives on branch **`family-split`** in `E:/Git/job-hunter-public/`, NOT yet merged to `main`, NOT yet tagged, NOT yet deployed. The root v5.2.0 monolith files stay intact until the cutover-approval gate (delete monolith, merge `family-split` → `main`, tag `v6.0.0`, then push/redeploy).
- The family shares ONE continuity stack (this one, at the orchestrator). Members carry a one-line stub pointing here. Per-member continuity would be 6× duplication.
- The `.job-hunter/` schema is documented in `job-hunter/references/workspace-contract.md` (orchestrator-owned, every member references it). Members read upstream artifacts if present and degrade gracefully if absent.
- Full design in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-job-hunter-family-split-design.md`; build order in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-28-job-hunter-family-split.md`.

## 2026-05-28, Continuity stack lives in the public repo; LF enforced; `_meta.json` compliance; Phase 3 reference wired

**Decision:** Four related calls, all on the v5.2.0 source in THIS repo (`E:/Git/job-hunter-public/`):
1. **The continuity stack now lives in the public repo.** It previously existed only in the frozen v4 workdir copy (`skill-builder-workdir/job-hunter/docs/continuity/`), where it pointed "forward" to this repo as "elsewhere." The 11-file stack was adapted forward into `E:/Git/job-hunter-public/docs/continuity/` and rewritten from this repo's perspective.
2. **Enforced LF via `.gitattributes`** after the self-improving-skills os-coupling guard caught CRLF in `scripts/verify_no_fabrication.py`.
3. **`_meta.json` gained `last_review_due` (2026-08-19) + `signals_observed`** for validate/CI compliance.
4. **`ats-formatting-guide.md` wired into Phase 3** (Mode A), it was an orphan reference; now load-bearing.

**Why:**
- A skill that has its own active repo should carry its own continuity layer. Pointing at a stack in a frozen ancestor is fragile and confusing for cold pickup, the workdir docs treated this repo as "elsewhere," which inverts reality.
- The os-coupling guard flagged CRLF in the *highest-stakes* file (the anti-fabrication safety gate). A CRLF `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang fails on macOS/Linux. `.gitattributes eol=lf` makes the fix permanent and prevents regression; `*.ps1` stays CRLF because it is a Windows-only installer.
- Validate/CI expect `last_review_due` + `signals_observed` in `_meta.json`; their absence was a compliance gap, not a behavior bug.
- A reference file that no phase loads is dead weight; wiring `ats-formatting-guide.md` into Phase 3 Mode A makes it pull its token cost.

**Consequences:**
- Future job-hunter continuity updates happen in THIS repo's `docs/continuity/`, not the workdir copy. The workdir stack is historical.
- All text/code surfaces commit as LF; do not reintroduce CRLF in `*.py`/`*.sh`/`*.md`/`*.json`/`*.css`/`*.txt`. The guard will catch it again if you do.
- `_meta.json` must keep `last_review_due` + `signals_observed` populated on every iteration going forward.
- This was a docs + OS pass, NOT a version bump, the skill remains v5.2.0. The `.gitattributes`/CRLF fix landed as commit `6d725cd`.

## 2026-05-20 (v5+), Public repo at `E:/Git/job-hunter-public/` is the new source of truth, NOT `skill-builder-workdir/job-hunter/`

**Decision:** v5.0.0 onwards lives in a separate git repo at `E:/Git/job-hunter-public/` with remote `https://github.com/wexxwuther/job-hunter`. The original `E:/Git/skill-builder-workdir/job-hunter/` is frozen at v4 and is the v4-ancestor, not actively developed.

**Why:**
- v5 work started in the context of building a public-facing repo for distribution (the GitHub release strategy).
- The public repo needs different file structure (LICENSE, README with badges, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, install/, .github/workflows/) that doesn't fit the skill-builder-workdir convention.
- Skill-builder-workdir's per-skill folders are designed for chain-internal iteration via `.install.ps1` to local harness paths. Public distribution needs different tooling (git archive, GitHub Releases, awesome-list submission drafts).
- Maintaining both in sync would be a continuous merge-conflict source. One canonical location simplifies everything.

**Consequences:**
- **Future job-hunter work goes in `E:/Git/job-hunter-public/`** unless explicitly retrofitting v4-era infrastructure.
- The two repos have completely separate git histories. There's no merge path. The v4-era continuity docs in `skill-builder-workdir/job-hunter/docs/continuity/` are historical artifacts; the live continuity stack now lives HERE in `E:/Git/job-hunter-public/docs/continuity/` (see the 2026-05-28 decision above).
- The `.install.ps1` in skill-builder-workdir installs the v4 frozen copy to local harness paths. The `install/install.sh` and `install/install.ps1` in `job-hunter-public/` install whatever's on `main`. They produce different installs, be aware which you're running.
- v4's `~/.claude/skills/job-hunter-v4/` is still installed on the local machine. The v5+ public-repo installers write to `~/.claude/skills/job-hunter/` (no version suffix). Both can coexist.

**Audit trail:** see 2ndBrain memory `2nd-brain/projects/job-hunter/` for the cross-session record.

## 2026-05-20 (v5.1.1), `applied_date` is the canonical tracker.json field for "when the user applied"; `posted` stays as "when the company posted"

**Decision:** introduced a new `applied_date` field in tracker.json schema (distinct from existing `posted`). Both fields are independent.

**Why:**
- The v5.1.0 `scan-stale` bug surfaced because the script conflated `posted` (company date) with the application date. False-positive stale flags.
- Renaming `posted` to mean "applied" would break backward compat with existing tracker.json files.
- Adding a new field is additive and backward-compatible. Old trackers without `applied_date` render correctly (em-dash placeholder); scan-stale correctly excludes them (no false positives; just no data).

**Consequences:**
- The agent MUST set `applied_date` when status moves to `applied`. Documented in SKILL.md Phase 4 "Field discipline" subsection.
- `generate_tracker_html.py` renders a new "Applied" column right after "Posted".
- `draft_followup.py scan-stale` reads ONLY `applied_date`. No fallback.
- Load-bearing safety test `test_scan_stale_does_NOT_fall_back_to_posted_field` enforces this.

## 2026-05-20 (v5.1.0), Internal-additions-only for v5.1; defer new-skill spinoffs to v6

**Decision:** v5.1 ships three internal additions (follow-up drafting, workspace export/import, expanded non-tech references). Defers interview-prep, salary-negotiation, and network-analysis as separate skill candidates for v6.

**Why:**
- "Quality over breadth", said no to options that would dilute the trigger description or introduce different trust models (auto-apply, LinkedIn messaging).
- Said yes only to additions that fit existing flows (follow-up = Phase 4.5; export/import = strengthens existing privacy promise; non-tech refs = honors existing generalist scope).
- A "salary-negotiation" or "interview-prep" mode inside job-hunter would re-introduce career-ops' 14-mode dilution problem we deliberately avoided in v4.

**Consequences:**
- v6 candidates: interview-prep (reads tracker.json + LESSONS.md), salary-negotiation (reads profile + tracker.json + LESSONS.md). Both are separate skills that consume job-hunter's outputs, not modes inside job-hunter.
- The 4-harness pattern (Claude Code / Codex / OpenClaw / Hermes) established in v5.1 is the convention going forward for any new sibling skill.

## 2026-05-20 (v5), Per-user learning loop architecture modeled on self-improving-skills

**Decision:** built v5 learning loop with 4 user-workspace files (DECISIONS.md, LESSONS.md, OUTCOMES.md, REJECTED_IDEAS.md) + 2 scripts (harvest_outcomes.py + propose_lessons.py) + load-bearing safety boundary (opt-in only, agent never auto-writes).

**Why:**
- User direction: *"the learning loop should be in personal space not shared with the general public, part of it would include files such as DECISIONS.md"* and *"check our self-improving-skills skill that one seems to work pretty well and see how the learning loop works in it."*
- Self-improving-skills' harvest → propose → apply discipline is proven. Adapting it (skill-iteration semantics → per-user-data semantics) keeps the discipline while changing the domain.
- Six guardrails (cold-start guard, opt-in only, deterministic translation, bounded influence, plain markdown, local-only) keep the loop honest. See lessons.md for the breakdown.

**Consequences:**
- The scoring weights in `score_posting.py` stay constant for all users. Learning happens upstream of scoring (how sub-scores are graded for THIS user), not at the weight level. This is a design constraint, not an implementation detail.
- `harvest_outcomes.py` cold-start guard is at 5 closed-loop outcomes. Below that, no signals proposed.
- `propose_lessons.py` is deterministic: same input → same suggestion. Reasons anchored in observed evidence (counts), never paraphrased.
- The agent NEVER auto-writes to LESSONS.md or REJECTED_IDEAS.md. Confirmed-opt-in only.

## 2026-05-18 (v4), Five upfront decisions for the career-ops fold-in iteration

**Decisions** (made before any code in v4 was written, captured here for posterity):

1. **Working location:** `E:\Git\skill-builder-workdir\job-hunter\`, the canonical source
   location. Edits flow source → install via `.install.ps1`. Rejected: working directly
   in the harness install, working in the v0.2 worktree (which is party-mode-review-
   scoped per its CLAUDE.md), creating a fresh worktree (overkill for a 5-step iteration).
2. **Drop interview-prep (career-ops Suggestion #4):** sibling-collision risk per CL36
   outweighs the UX argument at this point. Build #1, #2, #3, #5 only.
3. **Eval runner: mock only:** matches v2/v3 history; deterministic; free; fast. One final
   sanity run via `claude` adapter optional later if real-user signals warrant.
4. **Autonomy posture: end-to-end with one big checkpoint:** five steps run back-to-back
   with per-step eval gates; pause only on real blocker; final review bundled at end.
5. **Verification-before-completion gate explicit:** the four continuity docs MUST be
   revised against actual landed state BEFORE declaring done. Aspirational continuity
   docs are a documented failure mode (CL11).

**Why these together:** they're the decisions a future session needs to understand WHY v4
landed in the shape it did. Documenting them here means re-running the same competitive
review six months from now won't relitigate the same five questions.

**Consequences:** v4 ships with #4 deferred. If future signals demand interview prep,
the right answer is probably a NEW skill that takes job-hunter's tracker.json as input,
NOT a Phase 5 inside job-hunter. (Rationale documented in rejected-ideas.md v4 section.)

## 2026-05-18 (v4), Weights for score_posting.py

**Decision:** WEIGHT_CV_MATCH = 0.35, WEIGHT_COMP = 0.25, WEIGHT_CULTURAL = 0.20,
WEIGHT_LEGITIMACY = 0.20, red_flags_penalty as MULTIPLIER not additive.

**Why:** cv_match heaviest because it's the single most predictive signal of reaching a
human at the company; under-weighting it produces "interesting role I'd never get an
interview for" recommendations. Red flags as multiplier (1.0 - penalty) instead of
additive because a single severe red flag (pays-in-equity, SSN pre-offer) should be
able to torpedo an otherwise-strong score, not just chip away at it. Each weight has
its rationale documented inline at `scripts/score_posting.py` lines 49-79.

**Consequences:** load-bearing safety test `test_cv_match_is_heaviest_weight` enforces
the cv_match-heaviest invariant. If a future iteration changes weights, the rationale
comments AND the safety test MUST update in the same commit. The test
`test_thresholds_match_career_ops_block_g` codifies the 4.0 / 3.5 thresholds.

## 2026-05-18 (v4), Profile lives in user workspace, not skill directory

**Decision:** `.job-hunter-profile.md` lives in the user's working directory
(workspace), not in `~/.claude/skills/job-hunter-v4/`.

**Why:** Profile contains preferences and deal-breakers that may be sensitive
(specific company avoidances, comp expectations). Storing it inside the skill directory
risks accidental sharing if the skill folder is ever copied/shared. The dot-prefix on
the filename adds defense-in-depth: most `git add .` patterns skip dot-files.

**Consequences:** load-bearing safety test `test_no_sample_profile_in_skill_directory`
enforces this, any sample profile committed to the skill directory will fail the test
suite immediately. The privacy notice is bundled in the rendered template itself, so
the user sees it every time they open the file. The dot-prefix is enforced by
`test_profile_filename_is_dot_prefixed`.

## 2026-05-18 (v4), CSS source of truth is the asset file, not the script

**Decision:** Tracker CSS lives in `assets/templates/tracker.css`, loaded by
`generate_tracker_html.py` at render time. Inline CSS strings inside the script are
prohibited.

**Why:** Per CL43, inline rule-string blobs in emit scripts grow until they become
unmaintainable. Promoting to an asset file makes the CSS testable (drift test,
selector-coverage test) and lets future iterations modify styling without touching the
script's rendering logic.

**Consequences:** load-bearing safety test `test_script_has_no_inline_css_block` greps
the script source for `CSS = "..."` assignments larger than 200 chars and fails the
test suite if any are found. `test_css_asset_loaded_into_output` verifies a set of
load-bearing selectors appear in the rendered HTML, catching the case where someone
modifies the asset file but the script doesn't load it correctly.

## 2026-05-11, Retrofit baseline (v1 → v2)

**Decision:** Adopt the full `self-improving-skills` harness for job-hunter rather than keeping
it as a single SKILL.md file.

**Why:** Audit scored v1 at 2/15. The skill content was solid but the harness around it
(scripts, references, evals, _meta, CHANGELOG, continuity) didn't exist, so there was no way
to measure improvement or surface regression. Without evals, "improving" the skill is just
vibes.

**Consequences:** Every iteration from now on is measured. Frozen cohorts (v1, v2) catch
regressions. Future maintainers can re-run the eval suite locally and reproduce scores.

## 2026-05-11, Plugin-managed original is read-only

**Decision:** Never edit
`C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Claude\local-agent-mode-sessions\skills-plugin\.../skills/job-hunter\`.
All work happens in `E:\Git\skill-builder-workdir\job-hunter\`.

**Why:** The plugin path is managed by Claude's plugin system. Any modification gets silently
overwritten on next plugin sync. Editing there would feel like progress and produce zero
durable change.

**Consequences:** The improved v3 is at the working-dir path. If we want it active in every
project, it must be installed as a user-namespace skill at `~/.claude/skills/job-hunter-v3/`
(or similar). That install hasn't happened yet, pending user authorization.

## 2026-05-11, Standalone contract: parse_resume.py replaces sibling-skill dependency

**Decision:** Ship `scripts/parse_resume.py` (DOCX via python-docx, PDF via pypdf, MD/TXT/HTML
via stdlib) as a bundled resource. Sibling docx/pdf skills become optional accelerators, not
required dependencies.

**Why:** v1's "Reading Different Resume Formats" section directed the agent to read the docx
skill's SKILL.md before working with .docx files and similarly for pdf. That violates the
self-improving-skills standalone contract ("must work when copied to a system that has no
adjacent skill packages installed"). On a fresh install with no docx/pdf skills present, v1
would just fail.

**Consequences:** Resume parsing now works on any system with Python 3.10+ and `uv` available.
The PEP 723 inline metadata declares deps so `uv run` fetches them. If sibling docx/pdf skills
ARE present, the SKILL.md still mentions them as optional for cleanest-formatting *writing*
output, but reading is always self-sufficient.

## 2026-05-11, Description tuning: pack high-overlap vocabulary in the Use-when clause

**Decision:** Rewrite the description so all the natural-language trigger vocabulary lives
inside the "Use when…" clause (between that marker and the "Do not use" exclusion). Specifically
remove the standalone "Trigger on […]" phrase list that v2 had.

**Why:** The self-improving-skills mock runner extracts trigger keywords using a regex anchored
on `Use when |Use for |TRIGGER when:` markers, stopping at "do not use" / period / blank line.
Vocabulary outside that clause doesn't count toward the 2-keyword-overlap rule that drives
the mock runner's trigger decision. v3 take 1 had a clean "Trigger on…" list with specific
phrase patterns, and scored 58.3%, a regression from v2's 66.7%, because the broad
natural-language words that v2 had moved into the Trigger-on list weren't being counted.

**Consequences:** All future description rewrites must respect this. The Use-when clause
should: (a) start with `Use when the user wants to…` or `Use when the user mentions…`,
(b) list verbs and nouns that real user queries actually use ("find a job", "find jobs",
"openings", "tailor", "optimize", "search local", "search remote"), (c) include specific role
nouns the user might say ("engineers, managers, nurses, designers, analysts, freelance,
contract, backend, frontend, data, product, graphic"), and (d) end with an explicit "Do not
use for…" exclusion for the adjacent-but-distinct tasks. After any description rewrite, re-run
the mock eval before accepting.

## 2026-05-11, Frozen-v2 cohort snapshotted after v3 description rewrite

**Decision:** Run `snapshot_frozen.py --apply` after the v3 description was finalized, creating
`evals/frozen-v2.json` alongside the existing `frozen-v1.json`.

**Why:** SKILL.md (self-improving-skills) section 6.4: "Accept if live held-out improves AND
every frozen cohort holds or improves... The frozen cohorts catch the failure mode where you
tune the skill on the same signals you added to the live evals." A major description rewrite
obsoletes the prior cohort's relevance as a regression guard, so a new cohort gets minted at
that moment.

**Consequences:** Every future iteration must hold or improve on BOTH frozen-v1 AND
frozen-v2. The snapshot script refuses to overwrite, so frozen-v2 is now immutable. If a
future description rewrite is large enough to warrant another snapshot, it'll auto-increment
to frozen-v3.

## 2026-05-11, Single commit per major version, not per CHANGELOG entry

**Decision (skill-builder-side):** When committing the v1.16–v1.37 work in `E:\Git\skill-builder\`,
made one commit with a message that references all 22 CHANGELOG entries, rather than 22
per-version commits.

**Why:** The intermediate file states for v1.16 through v1.36 were never preserved (only the
final v1.37 state existed in the working tree). Faking per-version commits would have either
required reconstructing each intermediate state (impossible) or using the same final state
across all 22 commits (dishonest history).

**Consequences:** Per-version detail lives in `CHANGELOG.md`, not in `git log`. `git bisect`
loses some resolution. Acceptable tradeoff for honest history.

## 2026-05-11, Job-hunter v3 not yet installed globally  *(SUPERSEDED by next entry)*

**Decision:** Do NOT install the v3 improved working copy to `~/.claude/skills/job-hunter/`
or any user-namespace skills directory in this session.

**Why:** Two reasons. (1) Risk: overwriting the plugin-managed `anthropic-skills:job-hunter`
or shadowing it from a user-namespace location has consequences (plugin updates, user
expectations) that need explicit authorization. (2) Scope: user asked us to "refine and make
it even better", that's done; install is a separate action.

**Superseded:** Install authorized later in same session, see next entry.

## 2026-05-11, Install v3 side-by-side as `job-hunter-v3` (no shadowing)

**Decision:** Install at `C:\Users\Owner\.claude\skills\job-hunter-v3\` rather than
`C:\Users\Owner\.claude\skills\job-hunter\` (which would shadow the plugin-managed original).

**Why:** User said "install to V3", taking that literally. Two benefits: (a) the plugin-
managed `anthropic-skills:job-hunter` continues to work for users who invoke "job hunter" by
that name (no surprise behavior change); (b) the v3 install is reversible, just delete the
`job-hunter-v3` directory.

**Consequences:** Both skills are now invocable:
- `job-hunter-v3` → improved v3 (this skill, 15/15 audit, 100% trigger accuracy)
- `anthropic-skills:job-hunter` → plugin-managed v1 (single-file, 2/15 if audited)

The audit emits one info-level finding for the v3 install: directory-name (`job-hunter-v3`)
doesn't match frontmatter `name:` (`job-hunter`). This is informational only, not a score
deduction. If a future user wants the v3 to be the default "job-hunter" invocation, the
correct action is to move/symlink rather than rename the SKILL.md `name:` field.

## 2026-05-11, Local-only git repo, no remote

**Decision:** Initialize a local git repo at `E:\Git\skill-builder-workdir\job-hunter\` with
no remote configured. Initial commit `171347d` captures the v3 state.

**Why:** User explicitly stated: "we're just going to commit the workspace into its own local
repo, not public or private, just a local repo." Local-only preserves the work, enables `git
log`/`git diff` for tracking subsequent changes, and avoids any public/private repo creation
decisions.

**Consequences:** No `git push` ever. To collaborate or back up externally, a future session
would need explicit user authorization to add a remote. The local `.git/` directory is the
only durable copy of the version history; if the working-copy path is deleted, history goes
with it.
